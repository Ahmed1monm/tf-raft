## tf-raft ( Distributed KV Store based on RAFT - for pure educational fun )

The goal of this repository is to implement a Distributed key-value store based on RAFT Consensus protocol.
Work is still in progress, and the ultimate care is to make the code readable, maintainable, documented and easier to understand
so it might take some time, but let's enjoy building it.
